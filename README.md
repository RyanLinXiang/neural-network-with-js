# neural-network-with-js

### Description

This is the project's repository for my article "[Make your own neural network app with plain JavaScript (and a tiny bit of math.js)](https://lin-xiang.medium.com/make-your-own-neural-network-app-with-plain-javascript-and-a-tiny-bit-of-math-js-30ab5ff4cbd5)". In this article my goal is to show how to build a neural network with JavaScript from the scratch and embed it into a simple web app.

This web app can be used to train and test the neural network with the MNIST data set. Furthermore it allows the user to handwrite a digit and get a prediction from the network.

### Getting Started
## Installing
Due to the size, the MNIST data set is not included in this repository. Please download it from [pjreddie](https://pjreddie.com/projects/mnist-in-csv/)

## Starting
Please run the file index.html from a local webserver. Otherwise the file accesses won't work
